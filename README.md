For now just an experiment defining a weak type theory (WTT) - that is, a dependent type theory without definitional β/η laws - without setoids or quotients. Instead, we define substitution as a *relation*.

Once I finish the definitions, I will try to cut down on the dependencies (i.e. `Utils.agda`, `Utils.IdExtras.agda` etc...) to get something a bit more self-contained.
